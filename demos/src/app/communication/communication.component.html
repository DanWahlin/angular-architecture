<h1>Services/Components Communication</h1>
<br />
<ul>
    <li>An "Event Bus" can provide a loosely coupled way to communicate between objects.</li>
    <li>Services can expose a Subject/BehaviorSubject/ReplaySubject that other services/components can subscribe to for changes.</li>
    <li>State management solutions can also be used.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<button (click)="addCustomerPush()" class="btn btn-danger">Add Customer (push only)</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<button (click)="addCustomerClone()" class="btn btn-primary">Add Customer (push a clone)</button>

<br />
<br />

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <app-customers-list [customers]="customers" (customerSelected)="selected($event)"></app-customers-list>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <app-customer-details [customer]="customer"></app-customer-details>
    </div>
</div>

<h4>Notes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>This example shows how services and subjects can be used to provide a communication mechanism for 
            components. Click one of the buttons below and note how the customers count number in the upper-right corner 
            changes (event bus is used). Note that when a customer is selected in the "Customers" presentation component the details display
            AND the customer details display below the navbar (BehaviorSubject is used).</li>
    <li>The "Add Customer (push only)" button will call a service to add a customer but the returned customers data will not display properly and will not trigger ngOnChanges in the presentation component since the customers array itself doesn't change.</li>
    <li>The "Add Customer (push a clone)" will call a service to add a customer but the service will return a clone of the customers data. The presentation component's ngOnChanges will fire and the data will display correctly as a result.</li>
</ul>
