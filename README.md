# Angular Architecture

This code sample demonstrates different Angular Architecture concepts. It's used in the Angular Architecture and Best Practices video course on Pluralsight (https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/angular-architecture-best-practices) and in the Angular Architecture and Best Practices instructor-led training course (https://codewithdan.com/products/angular-architecture).

## Running the Application

1. Install the Angular CLI: `npm install -g @angular/cli`

1. Open the `demos` folder and run `npm install`

1. Run `ng serve -o` in the `demos` folder to start the server and launch the app
