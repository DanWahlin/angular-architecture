# Begin Standalone Lab

This BEGIN version is most of the way down the conversion road, leaving just what remains for workshop attendees to complete during the lab in order to get to the END state.

The REFERENCE version is the 100% NgModule state of the app, before any changes. It's a near perfect copy of the "routing-guards-and-preload-strategies" END state.

## Installation

Run npm install. It will probably fail because the Angular Material lib is older and possible out-of-sync with your cli.

You can try `npm i --force` to get over this hurdle.

## Lab Instructions

See the `README.md` in the `src` folder.
