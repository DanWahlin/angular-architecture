# Standalone Reference

This is the 100% NgModule state of the app, before any changes. It's a near perfect copy of the "routing-guards-and-preload-strategies" END state.

We're holding on to this REFERENCE version so can show ANYTHING as it was before conversion to standalone started. 

The BEGIN version is most of the way down the conversion road, leaving just what remains for workshop attendees to complete during the lab in order to get to the END state.

## Installation

Run npm install. It will probably fail because the Angular Material lib is older and possible out-of-sync with your cli.

You can try `npm i --force` to get over this hurdle.
