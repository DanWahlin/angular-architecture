# END Standalone Lab

The end state of the Standalone lab, after conversion from NgModule-based REFERENCE version.

The REFERENCE version is the 100% NgModule state of the app, before any changes. It's a near perfect copy of the "routing-guards-and-preload-strategies" END state.

## Installation

Run npm install. It will probably fail because the Angular Material lib is older and possible out-of-sync with your cli.

You can try `npm i --force` to get over this hurdle.
